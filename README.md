# Image-and-Video-Processing
This is the collection of my notes on the course Image and Video Processing from Coursera.


## 1. Introduction
* Weber's Law:
    * more sensitive to the change of intensity in dark than bright environment.
    * 图片1
* Mach Band Effect:
    * not constant perceived intensity, dependent on the contrast of two pics
* Discretization
    * in amplitude
    * in space
 

## Appendix of useful resources
* some interested projects from the course [EE368/CS232: Digital Image Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee368/index.html) in Stanford University.
